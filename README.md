## What is Azure Blob Storage?
Azure Blob Storage is a Microsoft Azure cloud-based object storage solution. It enables developers to use blobs to store and manage unstructured data such as documents, photos, videos, backups, and logs. Blobs can be grouped together to form containers, providing a scalable and cost-effective method for storing and retrieving massive amounts of data.

## Programming Languages for Consuming Azure Blob Storage
-	Users or client applications can access objects in Blob Storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. Objects in Blob Storage are accessible via the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library. Client libraries are available for different languages, including: 
-	JavaScript or (node.js): Utilize the Azure Storage Blob client library for JavaScript to interact with Blob Storage from web applications built with React.js or server frameworks.
-	C#(.Net): Use the Azure SDK for .NET to build .NET-based applications that interact with Blob Storage.
-	Python: The Azure SDK for Python enables Python developers to integrate Blob Storage functionality into their applications.
-	Java, Go, and more: Azure Blob Storage provides SDKs for multiple programming languages, enabling broad language support.
